## Constitution Types:

1. Balanced (平和)
2. Cold (阳虚 - Yang Deficiency simplified)

## Question 1: Body Temperature

### Option A: "I'm often cold, even when others are comfortable"

**Primary indicators:**

- Cold: +2 (main symptom of Yang Deficiency)
- Qi Deficiency: +1 (often accompanies coldness)

**Rationale**: Feeling cold is hallmark of Yang Deficiency. Qi Deficiency often co-occurs but coldness isn't its primary feature.

---

### Option B: "I'm usually comfortable in most temperatures"

**Primary indicators:**

- Balanced: +2 (indicates good Yang-Yin equilibrium)

**Rationale**: Temperature comfort indicates balanced warming and cooling mechanisms.

---

### Option C: "I often feel warm or overheated"

**Primary indicators:**

- Yin Deficiency: +2 (internal heat from Yin insufficiency)
- Heat: +1 (general heat pattern)

**Rationale**: Feeling hot, especially if it's dry heat (night sweats, dry mouth), suggests Yin Deficiency primarily.

---

## Question 2: Energy Levels

### Option A: "I often feel tired or have low energy"

**Primary indicators:**

- Qi Deficiency: +2 (PRIMARY symptom - this IS qi deficiency)
- Cold: +1 (fatigue often accompanies Yang Deficiency)
- Phlegm-Dampness: +1 (heaviness causes sluggishness)

**Rationale**: Fatigue is THE defining feature of Qi Deficiency. Can co-occur with coldness or dampness.

---

### Option B: "I have steady, consistent energy"

**Primary indicators:**

- Balanced: +2 (indicates healthy Qi)

**Rationale**: Good energy = balanced Qi and Yang.

---

### Option C: "I feel restless, anxious, or have fluctuating energy"

**Primary indicators:**

- Yin Deficiency: +2 (heat causes restlessness)
- Heat: +1 (general heat/inflammation pattern)

**Rationale**: Restlessness and anxiety indicate internal heat disturbing the mind (Yin Def or Heat).

---

## Question 3: Digestion

### Option A: "I experience bloating, loose stools, or feel worse after eating cold foods"

**Primary indicators:**

- Qi Deficiency: +2 (weak Spleen Qi = poor digestion)
- Cold: +1 (sensitivity to cold foods = Yang Deficiency)
- Phlegm-Dampness: +1 (bloating can indicate dampness)

**Rationale**: Bloating and digestive weakness = Spleen Qi Deficiency primarily. Cold sensitivity adds Yang Def component.

---

### Option B: "My digestion is generally smooth and comfortable"

**Primary indicators:**

- Balanced: +2 (healthy Spleen/Stomach function)

---

### Option C: "I have oily skin/acne, constipation, or feel heavy after meals"

**Primary indicators:**

- Phlegm-Dampness: +2 (oily skin, heaviness = dampness)
- Heat: +2 (acne, constipation = heat/damp-heat)

**Rationale**: This option combines damp signs (oily, heavy) with heat signs (acne, constipation).

---

## Question 4: Sleep

### Option A: "I sleep okay but wake up tired, or need many blankets"

**Primary indicators:**

- Qi Deficiency: +2 (waking tired despite sleep = Qi not restored)
- Cold: +1 (needing blankets = Yang Deficiency)

**Rationale**: Non-restorative sleep indicates Qi deficiency. Coldness at night adds Yang Def.

---

### Option B: "I fall asleep easily and wake refreshed"

**Primary indicators:**

- Balanced: +2 (healthy sleep = balanced Qi, Yin, Yang)

---

### Option C: "Trouble falling asleep, night sweats, or feel hot at night"

**Primary indicators:**

- Yin Deficiency: +2 (night sweats, heat at night = classic Yin Def)
- Heat: +1 (general heat pattern)

**Rationale**: Night sweats and nighttime heat are SIGNATURE symptoms of Yin Deficiency.

---

## Question 5: Food Preferences

### Option A: "Warm foods, hot drinks, soups, cooked meals"

**Primary indicators:**

- Cold: +2 (craving warmth = Yang Deficiency)
- Qi Deficiency: +1 (prefer easily digestible cooked foods)

**Rationale**: Body craves what it needs. Craving warmth = Yang Deficiency.

---

### Option B: "Balanced variety - both warm and cool foods"

**Primary indicators:**

- Balanced: +2 (no extreme cravings = balanced state)

---

### Option C: "Cold drinks, raw foods, salads, refreshing snacks"

**Primary indicators:**

- Yin Deficiency: +2 (craving cold = internal heat)
- Heat: +1 (general heat pattern)

**Rationale**: Craving cold indicates internal heat - primarily Yin Deficiency.
