# New Questions for 8-Question Assessment

## Rationale for Expansion

**Problem**: 5 questions cannot reliably differentiate 6 constitution types  
**Solution**: Add 3 targeted questions that distinguish overlapping patterns  
**New total**: 8 questions for 6 types = 1.3 questions per type (academically defensible)

## New Question 6: Moisture Symptoms

**Question**: "Which best describes your experience with moisture or dryness?"

**Purpose**: Distinguish Yin Deficiency (dry) from Phlegm-Dampness (damp) from others

**Options:**

**A)** I often have dry mouth, dry skin, or dry throat

- Yin Deficiency: +2 (hallmark symptom)
- Heat: +1 (heat can cause dryness)

**B)** I feel comfortable; no particular dryness or excessive moisture

- Balanced: +2

**C)** I have oily skin, excessive mucus/phlegm, or sticky sensations

- Phlegm-Dampness: +2 (hallmark symptom)
- Heat: +1 (can have oily skin from damp-heat)

## New Question 7: Body Build & Weight

**Question**: "How would you describe your body build and weight patterns?"

**Purpose**: Phlegm-Dampness correlates with weight gain; Yin Deficiency often lean

**Options:**

**A)** I tend to be lean or have difficulty gaining weight

- Yin Deficiency: +2 (often thin, "burns hot")
- Qi Deficiency: +1 (poor appetite can lead to being thin)
- Balanced: +1

**B)** My weight is stable and proportionate to my height

- Balanced: +2

**C)** I gain weight easily or feel heavy/puffy, especially around abdomen

- Phlegm-Dampness: +2 (hallmark - body accumulates dampness)
- Qi Deficiency: +1 (weak metabolism can contribute)

## New Question 8: Weather & Environment Sensitivity

**Question**: "How does weather or environment affect you?"

**Purpose**: Different constitutions react differently to weather - very diagnostic in TCM

**Options:**

**A)** I feel worse in cold weather or need extra layers

- Cold: +2 (Yang Deficiency worsens with cold)
- Qi Deficiency: +1 (cold depletes energy)

**B)** I'm generally comfortable in various weather conditions

- Balanced: +2

**C)** I feel worse in hot or humid weather; I prefer cool, dry environments

- Yin Deficiency: +1 (worse with heat)
- Heat: +1 (worse with heat/humidity)
- Phlegm-Dampness: +2 (humidity worsens dampness - VERY diagnostic)

## New Question 9: Thirst & Hydration Patterns

**Question**: "How would you describe your thirst and drinking habits?"

**Purpose**: Distinguish Yin Deficiency (thirsty, dry) from Phlegm-Dampness (no thirst, fluid retention) from Balanced

**Options:**

**A)** I'm often thirsty and prefer drinking cold water; my mouth feels dry

- Yin Deficiency: +2 (thirst + dryness = Yin insufficiency)
- Heat: +1 (heat creates thirst)

**B)** I drink when thirsty but don't think about it much; normal hydration

- Balanced: +2

**C)** I'm rarely thirsty and don't drink much; I may feel water "sits" in my stomach

- Phlegm-Dampness: +2 (dampness = fluid accumulation, no thirst)
- Qi Deficiency: +1 (weak Spleen can't transform fluids)

**Rationale**: Thirst patterns reveal fluid metabolism. Yin Def = insufficient fluids (thirsty). Phlegm-Damp = fluids accumulate improperly (not thirsty, feels waterlogged).

## New Question 10: Physical Stamina & Recovery

**Question**: "How is your physical stamina and recovery from exertion or illness?"

**Purpose**: Further distinguish Qi Deficiency (poor stamina) from Yang Deficiency/Cold (cold + poor stamina) from Balanced

**Options:**

**A)** I have good stamina; I recover quickly from exercise or illness

- Balanced: +2
- Yin Deficiency: +1 (if lean/active type)

**B)** I tire easily with physical activity and take a long time to recover

- Qi Deficiency: +2 (hallmark - poor stamina and slow recovery)
- Cold: +1 (Yang Def also has poor stamina)
- Phlegm-Dampness: +1 (heaviness limits stamina)

**C)** My stamina varies; sometimes good, sometimes I feel drained or get sick easily

- Qi Deficiency: +1 (fluctuating = borderline Qi Def)
- Balanced: +1 (or trending toward imbalance)

**Rationale**: Stamina and recovery are THE signature symptoms of Qi. This question gives Qi Deficiency multiple opportunities to score (Q2, Q3, Q4, Q10), which is appropriate since it's the most common imbalance.

## Updated Maximum Scores (10 questions)

- **Qi Deficiency**: ~20 points possible (most diagnostic opportunities - most common type)
- **Yin Deficiency**: ~16 points possible
- **Phlegm-Dampness**: ~14 points possible
- **Cold (Yang Def)**: ~14 points possible
- **Heat (Damp-Heat)**: ~12 points possible
- **Balanced**: 20 points possible (all B options)
