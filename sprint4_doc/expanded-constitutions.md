# Expanded Constitution Types - Sprint 4

## Overview

Expanding from 3 simplified types to 6 more specific constitution types based on user feedback requesting more detailed assessment.

**Sprint 3**: Cold, Heat, Balanced (3 types)  
**Sprint 4**: Adding Qi Deficiency, Phlegm-Dampness, Yin Deficiency (total 6 types)

---

## Rationale for Expansion

### Why these 3 types?

1. **Qi Deficiency** - Most common constitutional imbalance; distinct from coldness (Yang Deficiency)
2. **Phlegm-Dampness** - Highly relevant to Western dietary patterns (processed foods, sugar, dairy)
3. **Yin Deficiency** - Separating "heat" into two distinct patterns (internal heat/dryness vs inflammatory dampness)

### Why not all 9 yet?

- 6 types can be reliably assessed with 5 multi-select questions
- Maintains accessibility for Western users new to TCM
- Provides meaningful nuance without overwhelming
- Can expand to full 9 in future if needed

## New Constitution Type #1: Qi Deficiency (气虚质)

### Traditional TCM Description

元气不足，以疲乏、气短、自汗等气虚表现为主要特征

### Modern Translation

You often feel tired and lack stamina, even with adequate rest. You may catch colds easily, feel short of breath with light activity, and recover slowly from illness or exertion. Your voice may be soft and you tend to sweat during the day without exertion.

### Key Characteristics

- Persistent fatigue or low stamina
- Shortness of breath with minimal activity
- Weak or soft voice
- Frequent colds; slow recovery from illness
- Poor appetite or bloating after eating
- Spontaneous sweating during the day (not from heat)
- Pale or dull complexion
- Lack of motivation or enthusiasm

### Differentiation from Cold Constitution

- **Qi Deficiency**: Low energy is primary; may or may not feel cold
- **Yang Deficiency (Cold)**: Coldness is primary; low energy is secondary

**Can overlap**: Many people have both Qi and Yang deficiency

### Recommended Herbal Teas

1. **Astragalus Tea (黄芪茶)** - Tonifies Qi, boosts immune system, increases energy
2. **Ginseng Tea (人参茶)** - Strongly tonifies Qi and vitality (use American or Asian ginseng)
3. **Licorice Root Tea (甘草茶)** - Gentle Qi tonic, harmonizing, sweet
4. **Red Date Tea (红枣茶)** - Nourishes blood and Qi, mild and sweet

### Recommended Foods

**Proteins:**

- Chicken (especially dark meat, bone broth)
- Beef, lamb (nourishing but not too heavy)
- Fish (salmon, trout)
- Eggs

**Grains & Legumes:**

- Rice (especially sweet/glutinous rice)
- Oats, quinoa
- Lentils, chickpeas
- Sweet potato, yam

**Vegetables:**

- Root vegetables (cooked): carrot, parsnip, turnip
- Squash, pumpkin
- Mushrooms (shiitake, maitake - immune-supporting)
- Leafy greens (cooked, not raw)

**Other:**

- Dates, figs, raisins
- Walnuts, almonds (in moderation)
- Honey
- Warming but mild spices (ginger, cinnamon - gentle amounts)

**Why these work**: Easily digestible, nourishing foods that build Qi without being too heavy or hard to digest. Focus on tonifying and strengthening.

### Foods to Avoid

- Raw, cold foods (hard to digest, require more Qi)
- Excessive fried or greasy foods (tax digestion)
- Large meals (overwhelm weak digestion)
- Extreme fasting or restrictive diets
- Too many stimulants (coffee, energy drinks - deplete Qi long-term)

**Principle**: Build and preserve Qi through nourishing, easily digestible foods. Avoid anything that taxes your already limited energy.

## New Constitution Type #2: Phlegm-Dampness (痰湿质)

### Traditional TCM Description

痰湿凝聚，以形体肥胖、腹部肥满、口黏苔腻等痰湿表现为主要特征

### Modern Translation

You may feel heavy or sluggish in your body, especially in humid weather. You might experience excess mucus, oily skin, bloating, or a general sense of "stickiness." Your body tends to retain fluid and you may be overweight despite not overeating.

### Key Characteristics

- Feeling heavy or sluggish in the body
- Overweight or tendency to gain weight easily
- Excessive mucus or phlegm (especially in morning)
- Oily skin or hair
- Bloating, fullness sensation
- Thick coating on tongue
- Worse in humid or damp weather
- Brain fog or mental sluggishness
- Soft, loose stools

### Differentiation from Damp-Heat

- **Phlegm-Dampness**: Heavy, sluggish, mucus; less inflammation
- **Damp-Heat**: Also heavy, but with more heat signs (oily skin/acne, bitter taste, urgency)

**Overlap possible**: Can progress from Phlegm-Dampness to Damp-Heat

### Recommended Herbal Teas

1. **Pu-erh Tea (普洱茶)** - Cuts through dampness, aids digestion and weight management
2. **Oolong Tea (乌龙茶)** - Drains dampness, supports metabolism
3. **Hawthorn Tea (山楂茶)** - Breaks down food stagnation, reduces phlegm
4. **Barley Tea (大麦茶)** - Mild, draining, clears dampness

### Recommended Foods

**Proteins:**

- White fish, shrimp (light, easy to digest)
- Chicken breast
- Tofu, tempeh (in moderation)
- Beans (adzuki, mung - dampness-draining)

**Grains:**

- Barley, Job's tears (薏米 - strongest dampness-drainer)
- Brown rice (better than white for dampness)
- Quinoa
- **Limit**: wheat, bread, pasta (damp-producing)

**Vegetables:**

- Leafy greens, celery, bok choy
- Radish, turnip (cut through phlegm)
- Mushrooms (shiitake, enoki)
- Seaweed, kelp
- Asparagus, cucumber

**Spices:**

- Ginger (drying, warming)
- Garlic, onion
- Mustard greens
- Cardamom, fennel

**Other:**

- Lemon, grapefruit (cut through dampness)
- Green tea
- Light, fresh foods

**Why these work**: Light, draining foods that move stagnation and reduce dampness accumulation. Avoid heavy, rich foods.

### Foods to Avoid

- **Dairy** (milk, cheese, yogurt - very damp-producing)
- Fried, greasy foods
- Excessive sweets and sugar
- White flour products (bread, pastries)
- Processed foods
- Fatty meats
- Bananas (very dampening)
- Cold, raw foods in excess

**Principle**: Eat light, warm, and draining foods. Avoid heavy, rich, sweet, and cold items that create more dampness.

## New Constitution Type #3: Yin Deficiency (阴虚质)

### Traditional TCM Description

阴液亏少，以口燥咽干、手足心热等虚热表现为主要特征

### Modern Translation

You tend to feel warm, especially in the afternoon and evening. You may experience dry mouth, dry skin, night sweats, or restlessness. Your body runs "hot" internally and you prefer cooler environments. You might feel irritable when overheated.

### Key Characteristics

- Night sweats (without infection or fever)
- Dry mouth, throat, or lips
- Dry skin, eyes
- Restlessness or anxiety
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Flushed cheeks
- Thirst, preference for cold drinks
- Tendency toward constipation
- Afternoon/evening heat sensation

### Differentiation from Damp-Heat

- **Yin Deficiency**: Dry heat (dry mouth, night sweats, lean body)
- **Damp-Heat**: Wet heat (oily skin, heavy feeling, sticky sensations)

**Think of it as**: Yin Deficiency = not enough cooling/moistening; Damp-Heat = too much heat with stagnation

### Recommended Herbal Teas

1. **Chrysanthemum Tea (菊花茶)** - Clears heat, benefits eyes, calms
2. **Goji Berry Tea (枸杞茶)** - Nourishes Yin, benefits liver and kidneys
3. **White Tea** - Gentle, cooling, antioxidant

- Eggs (in moderation)
- Pork (neutral-cooling)

**Fruits:**

- Pear (especially Asian pear - very moistening)
- Watermelon, melon
- Grapes, berries
- Apple, peach
- Avoid: very tropical fruits in excess

**Vegetables:**

- Spinach, chard, lettuce
- Cucumber, zucchini (very cooling)

- Red meat (beef, lamb - too warming)
- Fried, greasy foods
- Alcohol (very heating and drying)
- Coffee (drying, heating)
- Roasted nuts (heating)
- Excessive baked/roasted foods

**Principle**: Cool and moisten. Choose foods that hydrate and calm internal heat. Avoid heating, drying, and stimulating foods.

## How the 6 Types Relate

### Original 3-Type System:

- **Cold** → Combined Yang Def + Qi Def
- **Heat** → Combined Yin Def + Damp-Heat
- **Balanced** → Ideal state

### New 6-Type System:

1. **Balanced** - Ideal state (unchanged)
2. **Qi Deficiency** - Low energy (separated out)
3. **Yang Deficiency** - Coldness (will add in future iteration)
4. **Yin Deficiency** - Dry heat (separated from Heat)
5. **Phlegm-Dampness** - Heavy/mucus (new category)
6. **Damp-Heat** - Inflammatory heat (will add in future iteration)

**Note**: For this sprint, we're adding 3 clear types. Yang Deficiency and Damp-Heat can be added later if needed, or we can keep "Cold" and "Heat" as simplified catch-alls alongside the specific types.

---

## Revised 6-Type Framework for Sprint 4

**Final recommendation - clearest organization:**

1. **Balanced** (平和) - keep as-is
2. **Qi Deficiency** (气虚) - NEW: fatigue, low stamina
3. **Yin Deficiency** (阴虚) - NEW: dry heat, night sweats
4. **Phlegm-Dampness** (痰湿) - NEW: heavy, mucus, weight gain
5. **Cold** (偏寒) - keep as simplified Yang Deficiency
6. **Heat** (偏热) - keep as simplified Damp-Heat

This gives you 6 distinct, non-overlapping types that 5 questions can differentiate!
