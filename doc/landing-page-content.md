## What is TCM Constitution?

Traditional Chinese Medicine views health as a dynamic balance between opposing forces—warmth and coolness, energy and rest, activity and stillness. Your constitution is your body's natural tendency along this spectrum.

Rather than treating symptoms, TCM focuses on prevention: eating foods that support your body's unique needs, adjusting to seasonal changes, and maintaining harmony before imbalance occurs.

This tool translates ancient wisdom into modern, actionable guidance—helping you tune into your body's signals and make small, sustainable changes.
