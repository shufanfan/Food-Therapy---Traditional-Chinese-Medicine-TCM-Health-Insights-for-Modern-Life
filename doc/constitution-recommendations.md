* This is the detailed reference file. To see the simplified json file, see data/recommendations-display.json

* 
## Overview
This document maps each of the 3 constitution types to specific dietary recommendations, including herbal teas and common foods available in US markets. Recommendations are based on traditional TCM food therapy principles (食疗).

---

## 1. Cold Constitution Recommendations

### Recommended Herbal Teas
1. **Ginger Tea** - Warms the body, aids digestion, dispels internal cold
2. **Cinnamon Tea** - Strongly warming, tonifies Yang energy, improves circulation
3. **Chai Tea (with spices)** - Warming spices support digestive fire
4. **Peppermint Tea** - Despite cooling nature, aids digestion when taken warm
5. **Licorice Root Tea** - Tonifies Qi, harmonizes other herbs, sweet and warming

**Why these work**: Warming herbs help supplement Yang energy and improve circulation. They support the body's metabolic fire and digestive function.

---

### Recommended Foods

**Proteins**:
- Lamb, beef, chicken (especially dark meat)
- Salmon, shrimp, anchovies
- Bone broth (deeply nourishing and warming)

**Vegetables** (cooked, not raw):
- Root vegetables: sweet potato, carrot, parsnip, turnip
- Squashes: butternut, acorn, kabocha
- Onions, leeks, garlic, ginger
- Mushrooms (especially shiitake, maitake)

**Grains & Legumes**:
- Oats, quinoa, black rice
- Lentils, black beans, kidney beans
- Walnuts, chestnuts, pine nuts

**Spices & Seasonings**:
- Ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg
- Black pepper, cayenne, turmeric
- Miso, fermented foods

**Other**:
- Dates, dried fruits
- Warm soups and stews
- Cooked foods over raw

**Why these work**: Warming foods tonify Yang and Qi. Cooked foods are easier to digest and require less energy to process. Root vegetables and warming spices support the body's core temperature and energy.

---

### Foods to Avoid

- **Cold/raw foods**: Salads, raw vegetables, cold smoothies
- **Iced drinks**: Any beverage with ice
- **Tropical fruits**: Banana, watermelon, pineapple, mango (too cooling)
- **Dairy**: Milk, yogurt, ice cream (cold and damp-producing)
- **Bitter greens**: Excessive kale, chard, cucumber (too cooling)
- **Wheat products in excess**: Can be dampening and hard to digest

**Why avoid these**: Cold and raw foods require more digestive energy to process and can further deplete Yang. Cooling foods counteract the warming therapy needed.

---

## 2. Heat Constitution Recommendations

### Recommended Herbal Teas
1. **Chrysanthemum Tea** - Clears heat, brightens eyes, calms the liver
2. **Peppermint Tea** - Cooling, disperses heat, refreshing
3. **Chamomile Tea** - Calming, slightly cooling, reduces inflammation
4. **Green Tea** (in moderation) - Cooling, clears heat, antioxidant
5. **Hibiscus Tea** - Cooling, supports heart health, reduces heat

**Why these work**: Cooling herbs help clear excess heat and inflammation. They calm the nervous system and support Yin nourishment.

---

### Recommended Foods

**Proteins**:
- White fish (cod, halibut, sole)
- Duck (cooling despite being poultry)
- Tofu, tempeh
- Eggs (in moderation)

**Vegetables**:
- Leafy greens: spinach, chard, lettuce, bok choy
- Cucumber, celery, zucchini
- Asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower
- Tomatoes, eggplant (nightshades are cooling)
- Seaweed, kelp

**Fruits**:
- Watermelon, pear, apple
- Berries (especially blueberries, blackberries)
- Citrus in moderation
- Melon varieties

**Grains & Legumes**:
- Barley, millet, brown rice
- Mung beans, adzuki beans
- Almonds (soaked)

**Other**:
- Coconut water
- Light, fresh foods
- Steamed or lightly cooked vegetables
- Foods with high water content

**Why these work**: Cooling foods nourish Yin and clear heat. Light foods reduce inflammation and don't tax the digestive system. High-water content foods moisten dryness.

---

### Foods to Avoid

- **Warming spices**: Excessive ginger, cinnamon, chili, cayenne
- **Red meat**: Beef, lamb (too warming and heating)
- **Fried/greasy foods**: French fries, fried chicken, potato chips
- **Alcohol**: Especially hard liquor and red wine (very heating)
- **Coffee**: Heating and drying
- **Processed foods**: Chips, fast food, processed snacks (inflammatory)
- **Excessive nuts**: Especially roasted/salted (heating and drying)

**Why avoid these**: Heating foods and spices exacerbate heat symptoms. Greasy foods create dampness and inflammation. Stimulants like coffee generate internal heat and dry out Yin.

---

## 3. Balanced Constitution Recommendations

### Recommended Herbal Teas
1. **Jasmine Green Tea** - Gentle, harmonizing, aromatic
2. **Oolong Tea** - Balanced between green and black tea, aids digestion
3. **White Tea** - Subtle, gentle, antioxidant-rich
4. **Rooibos Tea** - Caffeine-free, neutral, mineral-rich
5. **Lemon Balm Tea** - Calming, balanced, supports digestion

**Why these work**: Neutral, harmonizing teas maintain balance without pushing toward either warming or cooling extremes.

---

### Recommended Foods

**Balanced Approach**: Variety and moderation across all food groups

**Proteins**:
- Chicken, turkey, fish, eggs
- Beans and legumes in variety
- Moderate amounts of all protein sources

**Vegetables**:
- Wide variety of seasonal vegetables
- Mix of raw and cooked
- Colorful diversity

**Fruits**:
- Seasonal fruits in variety
- Both cooling and neutral fruits

**Grains**:
- Whole grains: rice, quinoa, oats, barley
- Variety and rotation

**Other**:
- Nuts and seeds in moderation
- Healthy fats: olive oil, avocado
- Fermented foods: yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi
- Herbs and mild spices

**Why these work**: The key for balanced constitution is maintaining harmony through variety, seasonal eating, and moderation. No extreme restrictions needed.

---

### Foods to Avoid (Minimal)

**General principle**: Avoid extremes rather than specific foods

- **Excessive processed foods**: Still inflammatory for anyone
- **Extreme temperatures**: Very hot or very cold foods in excess
- **Overconsumption**: Even healthy foods in excess create imbalance
- **Poor quality**: Highly processed, artificial ingredients

**Why avoid these**: The goal is to *maintain* balance. Extremes of any kind can push the body toward imbalance over time.

## General TCM Food Therapy Principles

### Temperature Energetics
- **Warming foods**: Generate heat, support Yang (ginger, lamb, cinnamon)
- **Cooling foods**: Clear heat, nourish Yin (cucumber, watermelon, mint)
- **Neutral foods**: Maintain balance (rice, potato, most grains)

### Cooking Methods Matter
- **Raw**: Most cooling, hardest to digest
- **Steamed/boiled**: Gentle, neutral
- **Stir-fried**: Slightly warming
- **Roasted/baked**: Warming
- **Deep-fried**: Very warming, creates dampness

### Seasonal Eating
- **Spring**: Lighter, ascending energy foods (greens, sprouts)
- **Summer**: Cooling foods, high water content
- **Fall**: Nourishing, slightly warming (squash, nuts)
- **Winter**: Warming, hearty foods (stews, root vegetables)
