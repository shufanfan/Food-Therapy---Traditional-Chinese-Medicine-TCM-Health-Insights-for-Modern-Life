# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting Summary

Meeting Information

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Attendees:** Huiqin (Scrum master), Shufan (Developer)  
**Sprint Duration:** October 16 - October 26, 2025 (10 days)

Team Capacity for Sprint 1

Given that this is the first sprint and the team consists of two members working part-time on this project, we estimated our capacity conservatively:

- Huiqin: 12 hours available
  - Survey design and content creation: 5 hours
  - Landing page copy and UX flow: 4 hours
  - Testing and refinement: 3 hours

- Shufan: 12 hours available
  - Front-end development: 5 hours
  - Back-end integration: 4 hours
  - Deployment and testing: 3 hours

Total Team Capacity: 24 hours

We agreed to keep the sprint scope modest to account for learning curves, potential technical challenges, and the need for iterative feedback between design and development.

Rationale for Item Selection
We prioritized items that would validate our core value proposition with minimal technical investment. Our selection criteria:

Validation first: Can we test user interest before building complex features?
Foundation building: Does this establish infrastructure for future sprints?
Achievable scope: Can we deliver something functional in 27 hours?

Selected for Sprint 1:
Maurijn User Story 1: AI-assisted guidance on food, training, and sleep

Classification: Must Have
Why selected: This represents our core value proposition across all three personas (Maurijn wants AI guidance, Emma wants integrated recommendations, Paul wants reliable advice). Rather than building a full recommendation engine, we'll create a survey-based prototype that simulates the AI's decision logic.
Approach: Landing page + multi-step survey collecting behavioral data (sleep patterns, health goals, current routines, decision preferences)

Partial validation of other stories through survey questions:

Maurijn US3 (transparency): 1-2 questions testing interest in seeing reasoning behind recommendations
Emma US1 (data integration): Question about current tracking tools to inform future development
Paul US1 (trust/verification): Question about importance of professional endorsements

---

Deferred to Later Sprints:

Maurijn US2 (adaptive suggestions based on daily patterns) - Requires baseline data we haven't collected yet
Maurijn US4 (notification controls) - Not essential for MVP validation
Maurijn US5 (progress summaries) - Depends on continuous tracking infrastructure
Emma US2 (on-demand anxiety techniques) - Requires content library and instant-access UX
Emma US3 (5-minute flexible routines) - Needs recommendation algorithm first
Paul US2 (quick stress-relief tips) - Similar to Emma US2, requires content development
Paul US3 (supplement logging) - Different feature track, not core to initial validation

User Story Breakdown into Tasks
Maurijn User Story 1 → Sprint 1 Tasks
Design Tasks (Huiqin):

Draft survey questions following "The Mom Test" principles:

Health goals and current pain points
Daily patterns (sleep quality, exercise frequency, meal timing)
Energy fluctuations and stress levels
Preferences for health guidance style


Create landing page copy explaining app value proposition
Design user flow: landing → survey → completion message
Test questions with 2-3 people for clarity

Development Tasks (Shufan):

Set up project repository
Build responsive landing page
Implement multi-step survey form
Create back-end data collection endpoint
Set up database for storing responses
Deploy to publicly accessible URL
Add basic analytics (completion tracking)

Acceptance Criteria:

Site works on mobile and desktop
Survey collects minimum 8 data points per user
Data successfully stored and retrievable
Publicly shareable link functional
Minimum 5 real user responses collected by sprint end

Questions and Clarifications from Product Owner
Q1: How do we measure success if we're not building actual AI recommendations yet?
A: Success = quality insights, not feature count. We'll evaluate:

Completion rate (target >70%)
Question clarity based on user feedback
Data quality and pattern visibility
Actionable insights for algorithm design in Sprint 2

Q2: Should we test interest in transparency (Maurijn US3) even though we're not building it?
A: Yes. Include 1-2 questions:

"How important is seeing the reasoning behind health advice?" (1-5 scale)
"Would you trust AI recommendations more with evidence/sources shown?" (Yes/No/Maybe)

Q3: What if we don't reach 5 responses?
A: Share via personal networks and relevant communities. If needed, extend collection 2-3 days while analyzing existing data. Quality over quantity—even 3-4 thoughtful responses provide value.
Q4: Which other user stories can we gather intel on without building features?
A: Add lightweight questions about:

Current health tracking tools (Emma US1)
Interest in professional verification (Paul US1)
Preferred time commitment for health routines (Emma US3, Paul US2)

This gives us directional data for future prioritization.

Sprint Goal
"Validate user interest in personalized health guidance through a functional survey prototype, collecting behavioral data to inform algorithm development."
Success looks like:

Live landing page + working survey
5+ real user responses
Clear insights on user needs and preferences
Foundation for Sprint 2 planning
