During our effort planning meeting, Huiqin and Shufan reviewed the project backlog in detail and discussed how to allocate priorities and estimate effort for the upcoming sprint. We began by revisiting the core user stories defined in the previous session to ensure both alignment and feasibility. The discussion centered around five primary backlog items, each representing a key component of the long-term vision for the AI-assisted health app. The team aimed to identify which features could be realistically delivered within the first iteration and which would require additional research or technical validation.

The first backlog item, “Personalized Daily Guidance,” corresponds to Maurijn user story 1, which focuses on AI-assisted recommendations for food, training, and sleep. We classified this as a “Must Have” item due to its central role in demonstrating the app’s core value proposition. However, during the meeting, both Huiqin and Shufan recognized that developing a complete recommendation engine was beyond the scope of the initial sprint. Instead, we decided to represent this function through a simplified prototype that simulates the AI logic by using predefined question flows in a survey format. This adaptation allows us to validate user interest and behavioral patterns before investing in algorithm development.

The second backlog item, “Adaptive Lifestyle Suggestions,” derived from user story 2, was categorized as a “Should Have.” Although it contributes to personalization by responding to user habits and body patterns, we agreed that this functionality should be deferred to later sprints. For now, our effort will focus on collecting baseline user data about mood, energy levels, and sleep quality. This approach provides the foundation for future adaptive features while keeping the current workload realistic.

The third backlog item, “Transparency and Explanation Layer,” linked to user story 3, was also marked as a “Should Have.” The feature ensures users understand the reasoning behind AI recommendations, which is crucial for building trust. Huiqin suggested that instead of implementing a full explanation module, we could test this concept by including one or two questions in the survey that explore how much users value transparency and evidence-based reasoning in health advice. This would provide useful insights to inform the design of future features without requiring major development work now.

The fourth backlog item, “Notification and Freedom Control,” was labeled as “Could Have.” It allows users to customize how often they receive reminders or health prompts. Both team members agreed that this feature enhances user autonomy but is not essential for the MVP. Therefore, it was deprioritized for the current sprint, as the focus remains on gathering and validating behavioral data rather than delivering a complete app experience.

The fifth backlog item, “Weekly Reflection and Progress Summary,” was also categorized as a “Could Have.” While it supports long-term engagement, we acknowledged that it depends on continuous data tracking, which the current prototype does not yet provide. Thus, it was postponed to a future milestone, potentially when the system is ready to visualize user trends.

In terms of effort measurement, we estimated each backlog item in terms of time complexity and value contribution. “Personalized Daily Guidance” was assigned the highest effort level, as it requires both content design and front-end implementation. Huiqin will handle the conceptual design of the survey questions and ensure they reflect real user motivations following “The Mom Test” principles, focusing on phrasing that avoids assumptions or leading responses. Shufan will manage the technical setup, including the landing page structure, front-end survey integration, and back-end data handling. The team decided that the sprint’s total capacity should not exceed one week of concentrated work time, with 60% of that effort dedicated to building the user-facing prototype and 40% focused on refining survey logic and testing.

To measure progress and ensure accountability, we defined a success metric for this sprint: by the end of the cycle, the app’s landing page must be fully functional, publicly accessible, and capable of collecting at least five real user responses. The results will be analyzed to evaluate user engagement, question clarity, and behavioral trends. This data-driven outcome will inform how the next sprint prioritizes algorithm design, feedback visualization, and adaptive recommendation mechanisms.

In conclusion, the effort planning meeting established a clear and realistic roadmap for the MVP phase. By grounding the plan in achievable goals, assigning clear ownership, and connecting each backlog item to the overall product vision, the team created a structured yet flexible foundation for iterative development. Huiqin will lead the qualitative design and content framing, while Shufan will focus on implementation and deployment. The consensus was that the success of this sprint will not be measured by the number of features delivered, but by the quality of insights gathered and the clarity of next steps it enables for future iterations.
