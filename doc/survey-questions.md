## Survey Questions

### Question 1: Temperature Preference

**Question Text**: 
"How do you typically feel in terms of body temperature?"

**Answer Options**:
- **A)** I'm often cold, even when others are comfortable  
  → Scoring: Cold +2, Heat +0, Balanced +0

- **B)** I'm usually comfortable in most temperatures  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +0, Balanced +2

- **C)** I often feel warm or overheated  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +2, Balanced +0

**TCM Rationale**: 
Temperature sensitivity is the primary indicator of Yang (warming energy) versus Yin (cooling energy) balance. Cold sensitivity suggests Yang deficiency; heat sensitivity suggests Yin deficiency or excess Heat.

### Question 2: Energy Levels

**Question Text**:
"How would you describe your energy throughout the day?"

**Answer Options**:
- **A)** I often feel tired or have low energy  
  → Scoring: Cold +2, Heat +0, Balanced +0

- **B)** I have steady, consistent energy  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +0, Balanced +2

- **C)** I feel restless, anxious, or have fluctuating energy  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +2, Balanced +0

**TCM Rationale**: 
Persistent fatigue indicates Qi or Yang deficiency (Cold pattern). Restlessness and anxiety suggest excess Heat or Yin deficiency. Steady energy indicates harmonious Qi flow.

### Question 3: Digestive Patterns

**Question Text**:
"Which best describes your digestion and related symptoms?"

**Answer Options**:
- **A)** I experience bloating, loose stools, or feel worse after eating cold foods  
  → Scoring: Cold +2, Heat +0, Balanced +0

- **B)** My digestion is generally smooth and comfortable  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +0, Balanced +2

- **C)** I have oily skin/acne, constipation, or feel heavy and sluggish after meals  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +2, Balanced +0

**TCM Rationale**: 
Digestive weakness and sensitivity to cold foods indicate Spleen Qi deficiency (Cold pattern). Oily skin, acne, and heaviness suggest Damp-Heat accumulation. Smooth digestion indicates balanced Spleen/Stomach function.

### Question 4: Sleep & Night Symptoms

**Question Text**:
"How do you sleep at night?"

**Answer Options**:
- **A)** I sleep okay but wake up tired, or I need many blankets to feel comfortable  
  → Scoring: Cold +2, Heat +0, Balanced +0

- **B)** I fall asleep easily and wake up feeling refreshed  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +0, Balanced +2

- **C)** I have trouble falling asleep, experience night sweats, or feel hot at night  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +2, Balanced +0

**TCM Rationale**: 
Waking up tired despite adequate sleep and needing warmth indicate Yang deficiency. Night sweats and insomnia with heat symptoms suggest Yin deficiency. Restorative sleep indicates Yin-Yang harmony.

### Question 5: Food & Drink Preferences

**Question Text**:
"What types of foods and drinks do you naturally crave or prefer?"

**Answer Options**:
- **A)** Warm foods, hot drinks, soups, and cooked meals  
  → Scoring: Cold +2, Heat +0, Balanced +0

- **B)** A balanced variety - I enjoy both warm and cool foods  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +0, Balanced +2

- **C)** Cold drinks, raw foods, salads, and refreshing snacks  
  → Scoring: Cold +0, Heat +2, Balanced +0

**TCM Rationale**: 
The body naturally craves what it needs to restore balance. Cold constitutions seek warming foods; Heat constitutions seek cooling foods. Balanced constitutions enjoy variety without strong preferences.
