## Project Context

## Selected Constitution Types

For this MVP, we selected **5 constitution types** from the traditional 9-type Wang Qi classification system:

1. **Yang Deficiency (阳虚质)** - Cold Constitution
2. **Yin Deficiency (阴虚质)** - Heat Constitution  
3. **Qi Deficiency (气虚质)** - Low Energy Constitution
4. **Damp-Heat (湿热质)** - Heavy/Inflammatory Constitution
5. **Balanced (平和质)** - Harmonious Constitution

---

## Rationale for Selection

### Why these 5 types?

1. **High prevalence**: These represent the most common constitutional patterns in general population
2. **Clear differentiation**: Can be effectively distinguished through 5 targeted questions
3. **Actionable recommendations**: Each type has well-established dietary guidance in TCM literature
4. **Complementary pairs**: Yang/Yin deficiency and Qi deficiency/Damp-heat represent the main energetic polarities
5. **Baseline reference**: "Balanced" constitution provides the ideal state for comparison

### What we excluded (for MVP):
- Blood Stasis (血瘀质) - requires pulse diagnosis, harder to assess via survey
- Qi Stagnation (气郁质) - overlaps significantly with emotional/mental health assessments
- Phlegm-Dampness (痰湿质) - similar to Damp-Heat but less acute
- Special Constitution (特禀质) - primarily about allergies, outside food therapy scope

## Translation Principles Applied

1. **Avoid medical jargon**: No terms like "meridians," "essence," or "pathogenic factors"
2. **Use sensory language**: Describe how conditions *feel* rather than theoretical concepts
3. **Relate to modern experiences**: Connect to recognizable wellness states
4. **Maintain accuracy**: Don't oversimplify to the point of losing TCM meaning
5. **Cultural bridge**: Show Western correlations without claiming equivalence
