# TCM Constitution Types - Translation & Simplification

## Project Context
This document translates Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) constitution types into modern, accessible language for Western users. The translation maintains the core TCM principles while making them relatable to contemporary wellness understanding.

## Selected Constitution Types

For this MVP, we simplified the traditional 9-type Wang Qi classification system into **3 core constitutional patterns**:

1. **Cold Constitution (偏寒)** - Tendency toward coldness and low energy
2. **Heat Constitution (偏热)** - Tendency toward heat and inflammation
3. **Balanced Constitution (平和)** - Harmonious state

---

## Rationale for Selection & Simplification

### Why 3 types for MVP?

1. **Assessment feasibility**: 5 survey questions can reliably differentiate 3 patterns, but would be insufficient for 5+ types
2. **Core energetic spectrum**: TCM fundamentally views imbalance along the Cold-Heat spectrum, with Balance as the ideal center
3. **Clear actionable guidance**: These 3 types have distinct, non-overlapping dietary recommendations
4. **User comprehension**: Simpler framework is more accessible to Western users new to TCM
5. **Academic validity**: We can defend this simplified assessment methodology to stakeholders

### How we consolidated the traditional 9 types:

**Cold Constitution** combines:
- Yang Deficiency (阳虚质) - insufficient warming energy
- Qi Deficiency (气虚质) - insufficient vital energy
- *Both manifest as coldness, fatigue, and need for warmth*

**Heat Constitution** combines:
- Yin Deficiency (阴虚质) - insufficient cooling/moistening
- Damp-Heat (湿热质) - excess heat with stagnation
- *Both manifest as heat symptoms and inflammatory tendencies*

**Balanced Constitution**:
- Remains as the reference point for optimal health
- Represents the TCM ideal of harmonious Yin-Yang balance

### What this MVP does NOT assess:
- Blood Stasis (血瘀质) - requires pulse/tongue diagnosis
- Qi Stagnation (气郁质) - primarily emotional, needs deeper psychological assessment
- Phlegm-Dampness (痰湿质) - nuanced distinction from Damp-Heat, requires more questions
- Special Constitution (特禀质) - allergy-specific, outside food therapy scope

**Future iterations** can expand to 5-7 types with 10-15 questions for more granular assessment.

## Constitution Descriptions

### 1. Cold Constitution (偏寒)

**Traditional TCM Basis**: Combines Yang Deficiency (阳虚) and Qi Deficiency (气虚) patterns

**Modern Translation**:
You tend to feel cold easily and may have lower energy levels. Your body prefers warmth—both in temperature and in the foods you eat. You might feel tired more often than others, experience digestive discomfort with cold or raw foods, and take longer to recover from illness.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Frequently feeling cold, especially hands and feet
- Low energy or fatigue, even with adequate rest
- Preference for warm drinks and cooked foods
- Pale complexion
- Digestive sensitivity (bloating, loose stools)
- Slow metabolism
- Catch colds easily or recover slowly from illness
- Lower back weakness or soreness
- Quiet voice, speak softly

**Western Wellness Correlation**: Similar to low metabolism, hypothyroid tendencies, chronic fatigue, or "running cold"

**TCM Principle**: Insufficient Yang (warming energy) and Qi (vital energy) lead to coldness and weakness. Treatment focuses on tonifying and warming.

### 2. Heat Constitution (偏热)

**Traditional TCM Basis**: Combines Yin Deficiency (阴虚) and Damp-Heat (湿热) patterns

**Modern Translation**:
You tend to feel warm or overheated, especially at night or in warm weather. You may experience dry mouth, restlessness, oily skin, or inflammatory symptoms. Your body prefers cooler environments and lighter foods. You might feel irritable when overheated or in humid conditions.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Feeling hot, especially in afternoon/evening
- Night sweats or warm palms and soles
- Dry mouth, throat, or skin (or conversely: oily, acne-prone skin)
- Thirst, preference for cold drinks
- Restlessness or difficulty falling asleep
- Flushed face or red complexion
- Tendency toward constipation or urgent bowel movements
- Bitter or sticky taste in mouth
- Feeling worse in hot or humid weather
- Quick to anger or irritability

**Western Wellness Correlation**: Similar to hormonal hot flashes, inflammation, hypermetabolism, metabolic syndrome tendencies, or "running hot"

**TCM Principle**: Insufficient Yin (cooling/moistening energy) or excess Heat/Dampness create inflammatory conditions. Treatment focuses on cooling, clearing, and nourishing Yin.

### 3. Balanced Constitution (平和)

**Traditional TCM Basis**: The same as traditional Balanced Constitution (平和质)

**Modern Translation**:
You generally feel energized and adaptable. You sleep well, have good digestion, and recover quickly from stress or illness. Your body adjusts easily to different seasons, weather, and environments. You experience stable energy throughout the day and emotional resilience.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Consistent energy levels throughout the day
- Healthy appetite with smooth digestion
- Restful sleep, fall asleep easily
- Comfortable in various temperatures and weather
- Rarely get sick; quick recovery when ill
- Stable, positive mood
- Clear, healthy skin
- Strong, shiny hair
- Bright eyes
- Well-proportioned body
- Good stress resilience

**Western Wellness Correlation**: Optimal health state; homeostasis; robust constitution

**TCM Principle**: Harmonious balance of Yin-Yang, Qi-Blood, and all organ systems. The goal of TCM wellness practices is to maintain or restore this state.

## Translation Principles Applied

1. **Avoid esoteric jargon**: No terms like "meridians," "essence," or "pathogenic factors" unless explained
2. **Use sensory, experiential language**: Describe how conditions *feel* in the body
3. **Relate to modern wellness vocabulary**: Connect to recognizable health states
4. **Maintain TCM accuracy**: Simplify without distorting core principles
5. **Cultural bridge**: Show Western correlations while respecting TCM framework
6. **Accessible but not superficial**: Provide enough depth to be educational

## Assessment Methodology Note

This 3-type simplified framework allows for:
- **Reliable assessment with 5 questions**: Each question can effectively differentiate between Cold, Heat, and Balanced patterns
- **Clear recommendations**: Dietary guidance for 3 types is distinct and actionable
- **Future scalability**: Can expand to 5-7 types in later sprints with additional questions

**Validity acknowledgment**: This is a preliminary wellness tool, not a diagnostic instrument. Users seeking comprehensive TCM constitution analysis should consult qualified TCM practitioners who use the full 60-question standardized assessment (ZYYXH/T157-2009).
