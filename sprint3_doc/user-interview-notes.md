## Key Findings

### 1. Single-Choice Limitation is Frustrating

**Finding**: Both users expressed frustration with single-choice questions. They felt multiple options often applied to them simultaneously.

**User Quotes**:

> "For the energy question, I feel tired sometimes AND I have steady energy other times. It depends on the day. I couldn't pick just one." - User 1

> "I'm cold in my hands and feet but hot in my torso. The temperature question didn't let me express that nuance." - User 2

**Impact**: Users felt the assessment results might not accurately reflect their true constitution because they couldn't express mixed or fluctuating symptoms.

**Recommendation**: **Implement multi-select functionality** to allow users to choose multiple applicable options per question.

### 2. Desire to See Full Score Breakdown

**Finding**: Both users wanted to see their scores for all constitution types, not just the winner.

**User Quotes**:

> "I got 'Cold Constitution' but I want to know if I'm also partially Heat or Balanced. What were my other scores?" - User 1

> "It would be helpful to see percentages. Like 'You are 60% Cold, 30% Balanced, 10% Heat.' That feels more accurate to how I actually feel." - User 2

**Impact**: Users felt they received incomplete information. Showing only one result oversimplifies their actual constitution pattern.

**Recommendation**: **Display score breakdown** showing percentages or raw scores for all three constitution types.

### 3. Interest in More Detailed Constitution Types

**Finding**: User 2 (with TCM experience) wanted assessment of more than 3 constitution types.

**User Quotes**:

> "I've had TCM consultations before and they told me I'm Qi-deficient with some Damp-Heat. Your tool only has Cold, Heat, or Balanced. Can it be more specific?" - User 2

**Impact**: Users with TCM knowledge felt the tool was oversimplified. However, User 1 (TCM beginner) found 3 types clear and accessible.

**Recommendation**: **Consider expanding to 5-6 constitution types** as a middle ground. This adds nuance for knowledgeable users without overwhelming beginners. Full 9-type assessment could be an "advanced mode" in future sprints.

### 4. Positive Feedback

**What users liked**:

- ✅ "The privacy explanation made me comfortable answering personal health questions. I appreciate that you acknowledge the questions are sensitive." - User 1
- ✅ "Beautiful, calming design. Feels trustworthy." - User 2
- ✅ "I learned about TCM constitution theory from the About page—I had no idea there were 9 types!" - User 1
- ✅ "Food recommendations are practical. I can actually find ginger tea and warming foods at my grocery store." - User 2

## Feature Requests

**From User Interviews**:

1. **Multi-select options** (2/2 users) - **CRITICAL - TOP PRIORITY**
2. **Show full score breakdown** (2/2 users) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
3. **More constitution types** (1/2 users) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. **Save/print results** (1/2 users) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - "Can I save these recommendations to reference later?"

## Usability Observations

### What Worked Well:

- Survey completion time: ~2 minutes for both users (as advertised)
- No confusion about navigation
- Both users understood their results
- Mobile experience tested on User 1's iPhone - worked smoothly

### Pain Points:

- **Single-choice frustration** was the #1 complaint from both users
- Both users tried to click multiple options and were surprised only one registered
- User 2 wanted to go back and change an answer but worried about losing progress (Note: back button exists but wasn't immediately obvious)

---

## Prioritized Action Items for Sprint 3

**Must Have** (critical user needs):

1. ✅ Implement multi-select survey functionality
2. ✅ Display constitution score breakdown/percentages

**Should Have** (requested features): 3. Improve question wording to acknowledge spectrum/frequency 4. Make "back" button more visible during survey

**Could Have** (nice to have): 5. Expand to 5-6 constitution types (not full 9 yet) 6. Add save/print results functionality

**Won't Have This Sprint**:

- Full 9-type expansion (too complex, defer to Sprint 4)
- Seasonal variations (scope creep, maybe Sprint 4-5)

---

## Sprint 3 Focus Recommendation

**Primary Goal**: Address the two universal complaints:

1. Allow multi-select (technical + UX change)
2. Show all constitution scores (transparency)

**Estimated effort**: 6 points total for both improvements

**Success metric**: Re-interview the same 2 users after implementation and measure satisfaction improvement
