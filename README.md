# Sprint 2 Goal

## Goal Statement
Establish a robust development infrastructure by implementing CI/CD pipelines and code quality tools, while enhancing user engagement features on the TCM wellness platform.

---

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Development Infrastructure (Priority 1)
- ✅ Set up automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

- ✅ Improve survey UX by removing auto-highlight on navigation

### 3. Platform Enhancements (Priority 0)
- ✅ Implement meaningful URL routing structure
- ✅ Update privacy policy for GDPR compliance
- ✅ Enhance typography for "Traditional Chinese Medicine" branding

---

## Key Deliverables

**Infrastructure:**
- GitHub Actions workflow configured for main branch
- ESLint passing with 0 errors and 0 warnings
- Prettier configured for consistent code formatting
- Branch protection rules for main branch
- Automated Netlify deployment on successful builds

**Features:**
- Google Forms integration for email subscriptions
- Functional Contact Us system
- Privacy policy page
- Improved URL structure for better SEO
- Enhanced UX for survey navigation

**Process:**
- Regular team meetings (2x per week)
- Code review through Pull Requests
- Automated quality checks before merge

---

## Sprint Outcome

Successfully transitioned from development (Sprint2 branch) to production (main branch) with:
- ✅ Complete CI/CD automation
- ✅ Zero linting errors
- ✅ Production deployment on Netlify
- ✅ Enhanced user engagement features
- ✅ Improved code quality standards

**Live Production URL:** https://foodtherapysprint2test.netlify.app

---

## Sprint Statistics

- **Total Story Points:** 10 points
- **Completed Items:** 7 items
- **Team Meetings:** 2 per week
- **Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks (Iteration 2)
- **Deployment Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## Process Improvement Plan

### Sprint 1 Retrospective Analysis

**Sprint 1 Performance Metrics:**
- **Previous Sprint Velocity:** 28 story points completed
- **Tickets Completed:** 14 out of 14 planned (100% completion rate)
- **Carry-over Items:** 0 tickets moved to Sprint 2

**What Worked Well:**
- ✅ Clear prioritization of infrastructure work
- ✅ Successful implementation of core features
- ✅ Good collaboration between team members (Huiqin & Shufan)

**What Didn't Work:**
- ❌ Team communication was not enough
- ❌ Branch assignment was unclear
- ❌ Some tickets lacked detailed acceptance criteria
- ❌ Learning curve for new tools (GitHub Actions, ESLint) not factored in

**Key Learnings:**
- TCM research took longer than expected
- Need buffer time for troubleshooting and learning
- Importance of clear acceptance criteria
- Value of incremental progress over perfect completion

---

### Ticket Quality Improvements

**1. Improved Ticket Granularity**
- **Current Issue:** Some tickets (e.g., CI/CD setup) were too large (5+ story points)
- **Action:** Break down tickets >3 story points into smaller sub-tasks
- **Owner:** Shufan
- **Implementation:** Starting Sprint 3

**2. Enhanced Acceptance Criteria Format**
- **Current Issue:** Acceptance criteria often too vague
- **New Format:**
```
  Given [context]
  When [action]
  Then [expected outcome]
  
  Technical Requirements:
  - [ ] Specific requirement 1
  - [ ] Specific requirement 2
  
  Definition of Done:
  - [ ] Code reviewed
  - [ ] Tests passing
  - [ ] Documentation updated
```
- **Owner:** Huiqin
- **Implementation:** Immediate (Sprint 3 onward)

**3. Better Estimation Practices**
- **Action Items:**
  - Use Planning Poker for estimation
  - Include "complexity buffer" for new technologies (+1-2 points)
  - Track actual vs. estimated time for each ticket
  - Review estimates in retrospective
- **Owner:** Both team members
- **Implementation:** Starting Sprint 3 planning

**4. Specific Actions with Owners**

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Create ticket template with acceptance criteria | Huiqin | Week 1, Sprint 3 | 🔄 Planned |
| Break down large tickets before sprint starts | Shufan | Before each sprint | 🔄 Planned |
| Add "learning time" estimates for new tech | Both | Sprint 3 planning | 🔄 Planned |
| Document estimation guidelines | Shufan | Week 1, Sprint 3 | 🔄 Planned |
| Create definition of done checklist | Huiqin | Week 1, Sprint 3 | 🔄 Planned |

---

### Sprint 2 Capacity Planning

**Realistic Commitment Based on Sprint 1 Velocity:**
- **Sprint 1 Completed:** 28 story points (14 tickets)
- **Sprint 2 Target:** 20 story points (more realistic, accounting for CI/CD complexity)
- **Actual Sprint 2 Completion:** 13 story points (9 tickets) ✅

**Team Availability:**
- **Huiqin:**
  - Available: 10 hours/week
  - Focus areas: UX improvements, documentation, testing
  - Capacity: ~7 story points/sprint
  
- **Shufan:**
  - Available: 12 hours/week
  - Focus areas: CI/CD, code quality, infrastructure
  - Capacity: ~7 story points/sprint

**Total Team Capacity:** ~13 story points/sprint (realistic target)

**Buffer for New Practices:**
- **Testing Setup:** 2-3 hours (added to CI/CD ticket)
- **Code Review Process:** 1 hour/week (included in ticket estimates)
- **Documentation:** 0.5 hours/ticket (added to each estimate)
- **Learning Time:** 2 hours/sprint for new tools/technologies

**Sprint 3 Planning Adjustments:**
- Reduce initial commitment to 8-10 story points
- Add explicit "tech debt" ticket (1-2 points)
- Include time for documentation in each ticket
- Schedule mid-sprint check-in to adjust if needed

# Getting Started with Create React App

test url: https://foodtherapysprint2test.netlify.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
