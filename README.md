# Food-Therapy---Traditional-Chinese-Medicine-TCM-Health-Insights-for-Modern-Life
Project Overview

This project explores how artificial intelligence can support everyday wellness through personalized and culturally grounded guidance. It combines modern data-driven insights with the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) philosophy of balance, prevention, and the interconnection between body, mind, and environment. The goal is to build a web-based platform that helps people tune into their bodies, understand their unique constitution, and make small, practical adjustments in food, rest, and routine that align with natural rhythms.

Problem Statement

Modern wellness tools often emphasize metrics—calories, steps, or sleep hours—while overlooking the deeper patterns that define real health. TCM offers a more holistic perspective, seeing health as a dynamic balance between Yin and Yang, and harmony between internal organs and external environment. However, its language can feel inaccessible to younger audiences. This project seeks to translate those TCM insights into modern, personalized guidance using AI interpretation, without losing their essence or depth.

Vision

Our vision is to create a companion that merges ancient wisdom with modern intelligence. Instead of another health tracker, this system acts as a reflective space where users can learn to observe their own energy, digestion, mood, and sleep through the TCM lens. The long-term ambition is to democratize access to preventive knowledge—helping people care for themselves in subtle, sustainable ways, long before symptoms arise.

MVP Definition (First Sprint)

The first sprint focuses on a publicly available landing page with a short five-question survey. The goal is to test user interest in the idea of personalized, TCM-informed wellness. The questions will gently introduce ideas such as “food as medicine,” body constitution, and daily balance. Data collected from the survey will inform our next design iteration by revealing user awareness, curiosity, and perceived barriers toward TCM-inspired guidance.

Future Iterations

After validating interest through the MVP, subsequent sprints will introduce personalized insights and interactive features—such as identifying a user’s TCM body constitution type, offering lifestyle suggestions based on weather, season, and emotional patterns, and explaining the reasoning behind each recommendation. Eventually, the AI model will be able to converse with users naturally and adapt advice based on real-time feedback, blending traditional diagnostic thinking with modern behavioral data.

Value Proposition

Unlike most health apps that offer generalized or surface-level recommendations, this platform provides context-sensitive guidance rooted in centuries of TCM understanding. It empowers users to reconnect with their body’s rhythms rather than outsourcing health to algorithms. By translating ancient frameworks (like the Five Elements, organ correspondences, and seasonal adaptation) into clear, modern language, the platform builds both trust and curiosity. The value lies in making TCM wisdom accessible, interactive, and relevant to contemporary lifestyles.

Architecture and Technology

The web platform is built with React for the frontend and lightweight backend services (Node.js or serverless functions) for data handling. Future iterations may integrate AI models via OpenAI or similar APIs to power adaptive recommendations. The design principles prioritize calm, aesthetic minimalism and ease of flow—reflecting TCM’s own philosophy of balance and harmony.

Research Foundation

The research process follows lean startup methodology combined with qualitative interviews guided by The Mom Test. Each sprint starts from real user observations—how people currently think about health, balance, and energy—and turns those insights into actionable product hypotheses. This ensures that the final system reflects genuine curiosity and need, not assumptions. TCM serves as both inspiration and interpretive framework for connecting the dots between user experiences and the system’s logic.

Sprint Planning and Milestones

The project uses GitHub Milestones to structure work.

Sprint 1 (MVP): Deploy a public landing page and 5-question survey.

Sprint 2: Analyze user data and integrate adaptive response logic.

Sprint 3+: Build personalized dashboards, evidence explanations, and reflection features.

Tasks are prioritized using the MoSCoW method and estimated through collaborative effort planning sessions. Each backlog item traces back to a validated user story, ensuring alignment between research, design, and implementation.

Team

The project is developed by Huiqin and Shufan.
Huiqin leads product vision, TCM conceptual translation, and user research.
Shufan leads system architecture, implementation, and deployment.
Together, they design the bridge between ancient knowledge systems and modern digital experience.

Ethical Principles

We adhere to transparency, privacy, and user autonomy. The system does not manipulate behavior or over-collect data. All recommendations remain optional and explainable. When TCM concepts are used, their traditional origins are clearly acknowledged and never commercialized.
