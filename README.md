In this sprint, we will deliver a simple interactive website landing page where users answer five short, everyday health questions inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

Based on their answers, the site displays a personalized wellness tip related to food and lifestyle such as “Try pumpkin and millet porridge this week to help clear internal heat”).

This MVP includes only the core interaction loop - the quiz, result display, and basic feedback buttons, with no login, database, or backend.
