# Sprint 2 Goal

## Goal Statement
Establish a robust development infrastructure by implementing CI/CD pipelines and code quality tools, while enhancing user engagement features on the TCM wellness platform.

---

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Development Infrastructure (Priority 1)
- ✅ Set up automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- ✅ Configure code quality tools (ESLint & Prettier)
- ✅ Implement automated testing and building processes
- ✅ Configure automated deployment to Netlify production

### 2. User Engagement Features (Priority 0)
- ✅ Implement email subscription functionality using Google Forms
- ✅ Add Contact Us feature via mailto integration
- ✅ Improve survey UX by removing auto-highlight on navigation

### 3. Platform Enhancements (Priority 0)
- ✅ Implement meaningful URL routing structure
- ✅ Update privacy policy for GDPR compliance
- ✅ Enhance typography for "Traditional Chinese Medicine" branding

---

## Key Deliverables

**Infrastructure:**
- GitHub Actions workflow configured for main branch
- ESLint passing with 0 errors and 0 warnings
- Prettier configured for consistent code formatting
- Branch protection rules for main branch
- Automated Netlify deployment on successful builds

**Features:**
- Google Forms integration for email subscriptions
- Functional Contact Us system
- Privacy policy page
- Improved URL structure for better SEO
- Enhanced UX for survey navigation

**Process:**
- Regular team meetings (2x per week)
- Code review through Pull Requests
- Automated quality checks before merge

---

## Sprint Outcome

Successfully transitioned from development (Sprint2 branch) to production (main branch) with:
- ✅ Complete CI/CD automation
- ✅ Zero linting errors
- ✅ Production deployment on Netlify
- ✅ Enhanced user engagement features
- ✅ Improved code quality standards

## Sprint Statistics

- **Total Story Points:** 10 points
- **Completed Items:** 7 items
- **Team Meetings:** 2 per week
- **Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks (Iteration 2)
- **Deployment Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## Process Improvement Plan

### Sprint 1 Retrospective Analysis

**Sprint 1 Performance Metrics:**
- **Previous Sprint Velocity:** 28 story points completed
- **Tickets Completed:** 14 out of 14 planned (100% completion rate)
- **Carry-over Items:** 0 tickets moved to Sprint 2

**What Worked Well:**
- ✅ Clear prioritization of infrastructure work
- ✅ Successful implementation of core features
- ✅ Good collaboration between team members (Huiqin & Shufan)

**What Didn't Work:**
- ❌ Team communication was not enough
- ❌ Branch assignment was unclear
- ❌ Some tickets lacked detailed acceptance criteria
- ❌ Learning curve for new tools (GitHub Actions, ESLint) not factored in

**Key Learnings:**
- TCM research took longer than expected
- Need buffer time for troubleshooting and learning
- Importance of clear acceptance criteria
- Value of incremental progress over perfect completion

---

### Ticket Quality Improvements

**1. Improved Ticket Granularity**
- **Current Issue:** Some tickets (e.g., CI/CD setup) were too large (5+ story points)
- **Action:** Break down tickets >3 story points into smaller sub-tasks
- **Owner:** Shufan
- **Implementation:** Starting Sprint 3

**2. Enhanced Acceptance Criteria Format**
- **Current Issue:** Acceptance criteria often too vague
- **New Format:**
```
  Given [context]
  When [action]
  Then [expected outcome]
  
  Technical Requirements:
  - [ ] Specific requirement 1
  - [ ] Specific requirement 2
  
  Definition of Done:
  - [ ] Code reviewed
  - [ ] Tests passing
  - [ ] Documentation updated
```
- **Owner:** Huiqin
- **Implementation:** Immediate (Sprint 3 onward)

**3. Better Estimation Practices**
- **Action Items:**
  - Use Planning Poker for estimation
  - Include "complexity buffer" for new technologies (+1-2 points)
  - Track actual vs. estimated time for each ticket
  - Review estimates in retrospective
- **Owner:** Both team members
- **Implementation:** Starting Sprint 3 planning

**4. Specific Actions with Owners**

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Create ticket template with acceptance criteria | Huiqin | Week 1, Sprint 3 | 🔄 Planned |
| Break down large tickets before sprint starts | Shufan | Before each sprint | 🔄 Planned |
| Add "learning time" estimates for new tech | Both | Sprint 3 planning | 🔄 Planned |
| Document estimation guidelines | Shufan | Week 1, Sprint 3 | 🔄 Planned |
| Create definition of done checklist | Huiqin | Week 1, Sprint 3 | 🔄 Planned |

### Sprint 2 Capacity Planning

**Realistic Commitment Based on Sprint 1 Velocity:**
- **Sprint 1 Completed:** 28 story points (14 tickets)
- **Sprint 2 Target:** 20 story points (more realistic, accounting for CI/CD complexity)
- **Actual Sprint 2 Completion:** 13 story points (9 tickets) ✅

**Team Availability:**
- **Huiqin:**
  - Available: 10 hours/week
  - Focus areas: UX improvements, documentation, testing
  - Capacity: ~7 story points/sprint
  
- **Shufan:**
  - Available: 12 hours/week
  - Focus areas: CI/CD, code quality, infrastructure
  - Capacity: ~7 story points/sprint

**Total Team Capacity:** ~13 story points/sprint (realistic target)

**Buffer for New Practices:**
- **Testing Setup:** 2-3 hours (added to CI/CD ticket)
- **Code Review Process:** 1 hour/week (included in ticket estimates)
- **Documentation:** 0.5 hours/ticket (added to each estimate)
- **Learning Time:** 2 hours/sprint for new tools/technologies

**Sprint 3 Planning Adjustments:**
- Reduce initial commitment to 8-10 story points
- Add explicit "tech debt" ticket (1-2 points)
- Include time for documentation in each ticket
- Schedule mid-sprint check-in to adjust if needed
