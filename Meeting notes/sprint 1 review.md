# Sprint 1 Review Meeting Summary

## Meeting Information

- **Date:** October 23, 2025
- **Time:** 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Location:** Virtual (Zoom)
- **Attendees:** 
  - Huiqin Hu (Scrum Master)
  - Professor John Alexis Guerra Gomez (Product Owner)

## Demo Presentation

### What We Demonstrated

We didn't have a product to show at the time of the meeting, so the demo focused on our planning and approach:

- **GitHub Scrum Board walkthrough** - showed our project structure and initial backlog organization
- **Three initial backlog items:**
  1. Survey Question Design
  2. Landing Page Design
  3. Deployment
- **Project vision** - MVP shows a landing page with a survey that helps people figure out their body constitution based on TCM principles
- **Sprint 1 planning approach** - how we prioritized items

## Product Owner Feedback

### What Met Expectations ‚úÖ

- Clear project vision and target users (health-conscious individuals interested in TCM)
- Good value to be delivered to the user
- Realistic about starting with MVP

### What Needs Adjustment üîÑ

**1. Survey Possibly Too Complex**
- Current plan for 5-question survey could be too ambitious
- Decision tree would be too large for Sprint 1
- **Recommendation:** Start with just 1-2 questions as a "trivia" proof-of-concept
- If we couldn't finish the survey in Sprint 1, move full survey to Sprint 2

**2. Backlog Too Generic**
- Current items like "Survey Design" are too broad
- Need much more specific, granular backlog items
- **Example:** Instead of "Build recommendation system," break it into:
  - Research 3-5 TCM constitution types
  - Create decision tree for 2 questions  
  - Design recommendation display
  - Document TCM source materials
- Each item should be specific enough to complete and demo in one sprint

**3. Missing TCM Knowledge Source**
- **Key question:** "Where is the TCM data/knowledge that builds your recommendations?"
- Need to document and translate TCM research with proper citations
- This should be a backlog item, not just background research
- **New requirement:** Create backlog item for TCM content translation and documentation

**4. Scrum Board Should Show Value**
- Board needs to reflect actual work that delivers user value
- Move away from just organizational structure
- Each item should be something demonstrable

## Backlog Status & Acceptance

### Original Sprint 1 Backlog (3 Items)

Since we were still in ideation, these items represent our initial thinking rather than completed work:

| Item | Status | Product Owner Feedback |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Survey Question Design | Planning | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs to be simplified - start with 1-2 questions only |
| Deployment | ‚úÖ Acceptable for MVP |
| Landing Page Content | Planned | ‚ö†Ô∏è Way to generic and broad, need to be more detailed and specific |

**Moved to Future Sprints:**
- Adaptive suggestions (Later)
- Transparency layer (Later)
- Notification controls (Later)
- Progress tracking (Later)

## Priority Changes for Next Sprint


**Key Insight from Professor:**
"Focus on delivering the smallest thing that shows value. For a TCM app, the credibility comes from your knowledge base - that's the real product feature."


## Key Takeaways

1. **Start smaller** - 1-2 questions, not 5
2. **Be specific** - Generic backlog items don't help track progress
3. **Domain knowledge is a product feature** - TCM content needs proper documentation and citations
4. **Show incremental value** - Each sprint should demonstrate something working
