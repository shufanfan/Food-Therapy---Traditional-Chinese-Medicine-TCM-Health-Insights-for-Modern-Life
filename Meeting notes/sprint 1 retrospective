# Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting Notes

## Meeting Information

- **Date:** October 26, 2025
- **Time:** 1:30 PM - 2:15 PM
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Location:** Virtual meeting
- **Attendees:** 
  - Huiqin Hu (Scrum Master/Designer) - Present ✅
  - Shufan (Developer) - Present ✅

## Sprint Velocity Analysis

### Planned vs. Actual Completion

**Original Sprint 1 Plan (Before professor feedback):**
- 3 broad backlog items planned
- Estimated: ~24 hours of work (Huiqin: 12h, Shufan: 12h)

**What Actually Happened:**

After the Sprint Review with the professor on October 23, we realized our backlog items were too generic and large. The professor's feedback prompted us to:
1. Refine our 3 broad items into 10+ specific, granular tasks
2. Treat Sprint 1 as a trial sprint and use the implementation process to get familiarized with the SCRUM process

**Sprint 1 Velocity:**
- **Story Points Completed: 11 (Maurijn story 1 (5 points), Emma story 3 (3 points), Paul story 1 (3 points)
- **Items Completed:** all 10 items
- **Hours Invested:** ~20 hours (documentation, professor meeting, backlog refinement, translation, design, implementation)

## Three Required Questions

What went well this sprint?
Completed all 10 planned issues, exceeding initial expectations (initially worried about not finishing basic requirements).
Efficient teamwork: Clear task assignment (huiqin focused on content/ideation; shufan focused on coding/deployment) and smooth collaboration.


What could have been better?
Familiarity with project management tools/processes: Struggled with GitHub (e.g., relied on main branch initially, slow to adapt to backlog system) and failed to link issues to pull requests (PRs)/commits in real time (all links added retroactively).
Initial task breakdown: Early backlog items were too large/vague (e.g., "survey design" as a single item estimated at 5–10 hours), causing overwhelm and delayed task initiation.

What will we do differently in Sprint 2?
More aggressive planning: Move beyond Sprint 1’s conservative scope (only 1 landing page) and add more features (uncompleted items can be pushed to future sprints).
Proactive tool adherence: Avoid retroactive GitHub updates (link PRs/commits to backlogs in real time) and use sprint-specific branches instead of only the main branch.
Regular synchronized meetings: Schedule 2 weekly meetings (online/in-person, 2 hours each) to align progress and avoid procrastination.

## Actionable Improvements for Sprint 2

1. Split large backlog items into small, time-bound subtasks (10 mins – 1.5 hours each) to reduce overwhelm and boost productivity. (assigned to Shufan)
2. Organize 2 weekly synchronized meetings (2 hours each) to align progress, resolve blockers, and maintain focus.	 (assigned to Huiqin)
3. Link this retrospective meeting note to the Sprint 2 backlog for traceability.	 (assigned to both team members)
